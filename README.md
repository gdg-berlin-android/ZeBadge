Droidcon 2023: The time a new badge saw the light of the day, full with delight and android programming capabilities.

Droidcon 2024: Same amazing badge but with better software, extension modules and a splash of AI.


# ZeApp
App for configuring static images on your badge from your Android phone. Connect ZeBadge to the phone with a USB cable, select an card to display and hit "Send". Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

You can build ZeApp locally or download the latest build from:

1. (Coming soon, see [#58](https://github.com/gdg-berlin-android/ZeBadge/issues/58)) [Firebase App Distribution](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/6373ffacb6e72c23)
2. [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/gdg-berlin-android/ZeBadge/releases)

# WebApp

Go to [ZeOffizialWebSeite](https://zebadge.app) If you have a compatiable browser (chrome, edge), great. If not, not so great.

You will see a website with a badge and several text boxes. Please put words and numbers into the boxes and check what happens. Once you are content with the results, attach ZeBadge, press the "sent to badge"-button and observe the magic of a flashing light. After a few seconds the new image is flashed and you can show it off.

This magic happens through WebSerial, a ktor backend, the dithering algorithm from Kotlin and some custom crafted js frontend. Fjoi.

## Building WebApp

Build server and pack into one archived jar
> ./gradlew server:fatJar

copy jar to server
> scp zeapp/server/build/libs/server-1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar myamazingserver:

log into server
> ssh myamazingserver

execute jar (jolo)
> sudo java -jar *jar 80

The last step started the remote webserver on port 80, with root rights. ðŸ¤“

## Building the WebApp with Docker 

Just run the following docker commands to build and run the server. 
```bash 
docker build -t ze-server -f ./zeapp/Dockerfile ./zeapp
docker run -p 1337:1337 -p 433:433 ze-server:latest
```

Open the http://localhost:8080/ should display "yes" in the browser.
